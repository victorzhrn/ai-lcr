**Least Cost Routing for LLMs.** Route each model to the cheapest provider that can serve it, and fall back automatically when one fails. Built for the [Vercel AI SDK](https://ai-sdk.dev).

> 🚧 Early development — the API may change. Dogfooded in production before a stable release.

The same model costs different amounts on different providers — and for images, no single provider is cheapest for everything. `ai-lcr` keeps a cheapest-first list per model, routes to the cheapest healthy one (⭐ below), and falls through on failure — the way phone carriers have done [Least Cost Routing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least-cost_routing) for decades.

## Supported providers

Any OpenAI-compatible endpoint works.

- **Text:** [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai) (widest coverage, list pricing) · [Kunavo](https://kunavo.com/?ref=hJ2uT3iW) (**30% off** every model)
- **Image / video:** [Kunavo](https://kunavo.com/?ref=hJ2uT3iW) (**30% off**) · [fal.ai](https://fal.ai) · [Runware](https://runware.ai) — routing on the roadmap

## Text model pricing

USD per 1M tokens, input / output. Official rates as of 2026-05 — verify current rates with each provider. OpenRouter passes list price through; Kunavo is a flat 30% off the official rate.

| Model | Official (in / out) | OpenRouter | [Kunavo](https://kunavo.com/?ref=hJ2uT3iW) | Cheapest |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Gemini 3 Flash | $0.50 / $3.00 | no discount | −30% | ⭐ Kunavo |
| Gemini 3 Pro / 3.1 Pro | $2.00 / $12.00 | no discount | −30% | ⭐ Kunavo |
| Gemini 2.5 Pro | $1.25 / $10.00 | no discount | −30% | ⭐ Kunavo |
| Gemini 2.5 Flash | $0.30 / $2.50 | no discount | −30% | ⭐ Kunavo |
| Claude Sonnet 4.6 | $3.00 / $15.00 | no discount | −30% | ⭐ Kunavo |
| Claude Haiku 4.5 | $1.00 / $5.00 | no discount | −30% | ⭐ Kunavo |
| DeepSeek V4 | $0.43 / $0.87 | no discount | not carried | ⭐ OpenRouter |

Kunavo carries Anthropic + Google. DeepSeek / OpenAI / Grok / Mistral route to OpenRouter — one config can mix them all.

## Image model pricing

USD per image, as of 2026-05 (provider list / retail; verify current rates). Kunavo is 30% off official. fal and Runware are compute providers — `ai-lcr` picks the cheapest per model (⭐).

| Model | fal.ai | Runware | [Kunavo](https://kunavo.com/?ref=hJ2uT3iW) | Cheapest |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Nano Banana 2 | $0.080 | $0.069 | $0.047 | ⭐ Kunavo |
| Nano Banana Pro | $0.080 | — | $0.094 | ⭐ fal |
| GPT-Image-2 | $0.210 | $0.094 | $0.089 | ⭐ Kunavo |
| Imagen 4 Ultra | $0.060 | $0.060 | — | ⭐ fal / Runware |
| Ideogram V3 | $0.060 | $0.060 | — | ⭐ fal / Runware |
| Seedream 4 | $0.030 | — | — | ⭐ fal |
| Flux 1.1 Pro | $0.040 | $0.040 | — | ⭐ fal / Runware |
| Flux Dev | $0.025 | $0.025 | — | ⭐ fal / Runware |
| Flux Schnell | $0.0030 | $0.0013 | — | ⭐ Runware |
| Qwen-Image | — | $0.0038 | — | ⭐ Runware |
| FLUX.2 Klein 4B | — | $0.0006 | — | ⭐ Runware |

## Video model pricing

USD per second, as of 2026-05 — verify current rates. Video billing differs by provider, so a clean cross-provider table isn't apples-to-apples: fal.ai and Runware charge per second, while Kunavo's Veo is per clip (Fast ~$0.28 / Lite ~$0.168 / Quality ~$1.34). Below are fal.ai's per-second rates (the video workhorse in testing); a normalized fal / Runware / Kunavo comparison is a TODO.

| Model | fal.ai ($/s) |
|---|---|
| Seedance Lite | $0.036 |
| Hailuo 02 Standard | $0.045 |
| LTX-2 | $0.060 |
| Kling 2.6 Pro | $0.070 |
| WAN 2.2 | $0.080 |
| Veo 3.1 Lite | $0.080 |
| Kling V3 Pro | $0.112 |
| Seedance Pro | $0.124 |
| Veo 3.1 (audio-on) | $0.400 |

## Install

```bash
npm install ai-lcr
```

`ai` (the Vercel AI SDK) is a peer dependency.

## Quick start

```ts
import { createLCR } from "ai-lcr";
import { createOpenAICompatible } from "@ai-sdk/openai-compatible";
import { generateText } from "ai";

const kunavo = createOpenAICompatible({
  name: "kunavo",
  baseURL: "https://api.kunavo.com/v1",
  apiKey: process.env.KUNAVO_API_KEY,
});
const openrouter = createOpenAICompatible({
  name: "openrouter",
  baseURL: "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1",
  apiKey: process.env.OPENROUTER_API_KEY,
});

const lcr = createLCR({
  autoSort: true, // sort each model's providers cheapest-first by `cost`
  models: {
    // One logical model, served cheapest-first across providers.
    "gemini-3-flash": [
      { model: kunavo("gemini-3-flash"), label: "kunavo", cost: { input: 0.35, output: 2.1 } },
      { model: openrouter("google/gemini-3-flash-preview"), label: "openrouter", cost: { input: 0.5, output: 3.0 } },
    ],
  },
  // See exactly what each call cost, on whichever provider served it.
  onCost: ({ provider, costUsd }) => console.log(`${provider}: $${costUsd.toFixed(6)}`),
});

const { text } = await generateText({
  model: lcr("gemini-3-flash"),
  prompt: "Explain Least Cost Routing in one sentence.",
});
```

`cost` and `label` are optional — pass bare models (`kunavo("gemini-3-flash")`) if you don't need cost accounting or `autoSort`. `lcr("gemini-3-flash")` returns a standard AI SDK model, so it works with `generateText`, `streamText`, `generateObject`, tools, and agents.

## How it routes

1. **Cheapest first.** Providers are tried in order — list them cheapest-first, or set `autoSort: true` to order them by `cost` automatically.
2. **Fall through on failure.** On a retryable error (rate limit, 5xx, timeout) it advances to the next provider, streaming-safe.
3. **Recover.** After an idle window (`resetIntervalMs`, default 60s) it snaps back to the cheapest provider.

## Roadmap

- [x] Own failover engine — cheapest-first routing + streaming-safe fallback, no external routing dependency
- [x] Real per-call cost accounting (`onCost`)
- [x] Auto cheapest-first ordering (`autoSort`) from per-provider `cost`
- [ ] Bundled price table for zero-config pricing (drop the manual `cost` numbers)
- [ ] Provider-quirk middleware (transparently patch known per-provider request quirks)
- [ ] Offline capability probe (tool-calling / caching / streaming) → trust matrix
- [ ] Image & video model routing (fal.ai / Runware / Kunavo)

## Affiliate disclosure

`ai-lcr` is provider-neutral and works with any OpenAI-compatible endpoint. The author holds an affiliate arrangement with **[Kunavo](https://kunavo.com/?ref=hJ2uT3iW)**, which — at 30% off official rates — is often (not always) the cheapest option, as the tables above show. Signing up through that link may earn the author a share. You're never required to use it; bring your own providers and routing works identically.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run typecheck
npm test          # mocked routing/failover tests + live Kunavo tests
```

The suite covers cheapest-first routing, failover on retryable errors (and *not* failing over on a 400), exhausting the whole chain, and a real broken-provider → Kunavo recovery. Live tests run only when `KUNAVO_API_KEY` is set in the environment; otherwise they're skipped.

## Credits

The streaming-safe failover approach is adapted from [`ai-fallback`](https://github.com/remorses/ai-fallback) (MIT) — reimplemented in-house so ai-lcr owns its engine and layers cost accounting + routing directly into it. Built on the [Vercel AI SDK](https://ai-sdk.dev).
